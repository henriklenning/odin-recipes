    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <li>
        3 cl Irish Whiskey,
        1-2 teaspoons Sugar,
        9 cl Coffee and about
        5 cl Cream.
    </li>
    <li>
        <br>
        <ul>1. Start by brewing some really good coffee</ul>
        <ul>2. Boil up some water and pour it into the glass to heat it up</ul>
        <ul>3. Prepare your cream. It's going to be lightly whisked, 
            <br> which means it's supposed to be liquid but still fluffy</ul>
        <ul>4. Remove the hot water from the glass before making the drink</ul>
        <ul>5. Add the sugar</ul>
        <ul>6. Add the whiskey</ul>
        <ul>7. Add your coffee. Leave about 1-1,5 cm of the glass to fit 
            <br> the whipped cream</ul>
        <ul>8. Stir so that the sugar dissolves</ul>
        <ul>9. Carefully pour the cream with the help of a spoon so that it 
            <br> sits like a layer on top of the drink</ul>
        <ul>10. Garnish with some grated chocolate</ul>
        <ul>11. Serve without straw. An Irish Coffee is best when consumed 
            <br> through the cool cream</ul>
    </li>
